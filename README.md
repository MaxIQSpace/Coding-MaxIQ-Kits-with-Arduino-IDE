## Getting Started with MaxIQ Kits & Arduino

### Please download and review material included in "Lab 0" Folder to get started with your MaxIQ kits and the Arduino IDE
Included is:
1. Lab0(2).doc
   - Instructional walkthrough to be utilized alongside support video
2. Blink.ino
   - Example script
   
####Please see updated instructions for those running Arduino IDE v2.0+ 

Please see https://www.arduino.cc/en/software to find the appropriate Arduino IDE download for you

### Find additional resources below detailing libraries and methods of installation into the Arduino IDE
#### Guide sourced from Arduino, please see link at bottom for complete guide

Once you are comfortable with the Arduino software and using the built-in functions, you may want to extend the ability of your Arduino with additional libraries.

## What are Libraries?
Libraries are a collection of code that makes it easy for you to connect to a sensor, display, module, etc. For example, the built-in LiquidCrystal library makes it easy to talk to character LCD displays. There are hundreds of additional libraries available on the Internet for download. The built-in libraries and some of these additional libraries are listed in the reference. To use the additional libraries, you will need to install them.
